## Pysch SSH
FIRST OFF ALL

  it's not like u think. And I built it for getring into my campus machine so i can learn about unix sys and etc.... * _ *
  well I have reconfigured firewall so it will ignore conns outside the local network
  
  
It's not a crazy backdoor like rootkit or smtg
 
I'm jst learning mahnn may be in the future.

BIG CONES OF PYSCH SSH

  - You need to run the script in the target physically and u need to know the **root password** of it (Basically I can do it) \_(o_o)_/ 
  - That's it

BASICALLY PYSCH SSH DOES

  - setup ssh auto when booting
  - configure ufw firewall
  - enable x11forwarding
  - changes the port


Next best thing i can say to you is **ONLY USE FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES** o_O

Remember we're not **Evils**. we respect sys around us
